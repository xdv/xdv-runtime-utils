# xdv-runtime-utils

XDV runtime utility source package.

This directory now hosts the runtime utility application sources that were
previously consumed from `xdv-core/src`.

Primary source path:
- `xdv-runtime-utils/src`

Current unit files in this package retain the existing `xdv_core_*` naming
contract for compatibility with current shell/runtime command bindings.
